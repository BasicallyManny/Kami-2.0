# **Tech Stack**

**Frontend:**

 Development of the DiscordBot using Discord.PY.
   1. Discord.PY
    - Primary library for creating bot commands and interactions within Discord. Supports slash commands, message embeds, and async operations.

**Backend:** 

To solve the backend logic, develop front-end APIs to interact with and
             manage linguistic processing through LangChain.

   1. FastAPI
    - A web framework based on python3 enables the user to quickly and easily build APIs  
      for their web applications.
    - Develop front-end APIs to interact with and manage linguistic processing through
      LangChain.

   2. LangChain
    - A Python framework for creating apps stacking multiple language models in a single
      pipeline. Its purpose is to offer a simple way of integrating
      language models into apps and other types of software, granting increased text 
      processing capacities.
    - To process and manipulate natural language text, enhancing the application's ability 
      to handle user inputs and provide meaningful responses.

   3. MongoDB
    - A NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. It stores 
      data in JSON-like documents, which makes it a natural fit for applications 
      that handle a variety of data types.
    - To store user information, server information, and Minecraft coordinates.
